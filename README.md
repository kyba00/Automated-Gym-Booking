# Automated-Gym-Booking

This program can serve as an example or base for anybody who wants to automate bookings on a website.

I was living in a Condo with a gym during the pandemic that used a first come, first served booking system and got tired of my neighbours instant locking the good time slots. So I developed this program with plans to host it on Haruko where it could run automatically and book the time I wanted a week in advance at the moment it became available.
